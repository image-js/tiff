TIFF image decoder written entirely in JavaScript.

## Installation

```
$ npm install tiff
```

## Compatibility

### Platform

This package is written using ES2015 features. It is natively compatible with recent versions of Google Chrome
and Node.js. You can transpile it with a tool like [babel](https://babeljs.io/) if you need to support more
JavaScript engines.

### [TIFF standard](./TIFF6.pdf)

The library can currently decode greyscale and RGB images (8, 16 or 32 bits). It does not support any compression algorithm yet.

## API

The package is in early development and API should be considered unstable.  
I am currently only focused on extending TIFF format support and will work on the API afterwards.

### tiff.decode(data[, options])

Decodes the file and returns TIFF IFDs.

#### IFD object

Each decoded image is stored in an `IFD`.

##### IFD#data

The `data` property is a Typed Array containing the pixel data. It is a `Uint8Array` for 8bit images, a `Uint16Array` for 16bit images and a `Float32Array` for 32bit images.

##### Other properties of IFD

* `size` - number of pixels
* `width` - number of columns
* `height` - number of rows
* `bitsPerSample` - bit depth
* `xResolution`
* `yResolution`
* `resolutionUnit`

### tiff.pageCount(data)

Returns the number of IFDs (pages) in the file.

### tiff.isMultiPage(data)

Returns true if the file has 2 or more IFDs (pages) and false if it has 1. This is slightly more
efficient than calling `pageCount()` if all you need to know is whether the file has multiple
pages or not.
